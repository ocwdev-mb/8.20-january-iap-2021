#### {{% resource_link ff411b92-a5ea-2fa8-fbd0-85f7bff43f5d "Week 1: Foundations of Special Relativity" %}}

We start with an introduction, the organizational structure of the course, and dive into a discussion of waves, light, and the Michelson-Morley experiment.

In the second week, we increase the speed and cover time dilation and length contraction. We introduce spacetime diagrams, a useful tool to discuss paradoxes in special relativity.

Realizing that space and time together describe events, we introduce 4-vectors and the algebra of Lorentz transformations. The concepts of velocity, momentum, and energy are introduced using a 4-vector notation and then used to describe collisions.

In the last week, we look beyond the core content of special relativity with a discussion of tests and applications of special relativity including particle physics, GPS, and electromagnetism, and we take a glance towards general relativity. The course concludes with a review.
