**Description:** Professor David Kaiser teaches in the physics department at MIT and is also a historian of science. In this guest lecture, he describes how the most accomplished physicists of the mid-to-late 19{{< sup "th" >}} century were thinking about motion of bodies through space and time, and how, at the end of that century, a rather young and very little-known person named Albert Einstein began asking similar questions but often in very different ways. (01:13:40)
